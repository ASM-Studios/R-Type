RFC 9999 et des brouettes - RType Binary Data Transfer Procol (RBDTP)

1. Introduction

    This document describes the RType Binary Data Transfer Protocol (RBDTP),
    which is a protocol for transferring binary data between a server and a
    client.  The protocol is designed to be simple and efficient.

2. Overview

    The RBDTP protocol is a simple protocol that allows a client to request
    data from a server.  The server responds with the requested data if
    needed.

3. Header

    Used to send any type of message (movement, chat, etc.) over the network,
    with the `id` identifying the type of request, and `payload` containing the
    data (such as player movement or chat content).
    
    To ensure no extra memory padding is added, all structures are packed.

    class NonTypedQuery {
        RequestType requestType;
        std::array<char, MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE> _fill;
    };
    
    template <typename Payload>
    class TypedQuery {
        RequestType requestType;
        Payload payload;
        std::array<char, MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE - sizeof(Payload)> _fill;
    };

    NonTypedQuery and TypedQuery are same elements except that TypedQuery has
    a typed payload.

    class RawRequest {
        NonTypedQuery query;
    };

    RawRequest is the class used by the socket to send queries.

4. Protocol

    ID are to be defined.

    4.1. Client to Server

        4.1.1. Movement

            Input:
                - ID: 0x0000
                - Request: ecs::component::Input

    4.2. Server to Client

        Update player:
            - ID: 0x0000
            - Request: UpdatePlayer

        Update team player:
            - ID: 0x0000
            - Request: UpdateTeamPlayer

        Create entity:
            - ID: 0x0000
            - Request: CreateEntity

        Update entity:
            - ID: 0x0000
            - Request: UpdateEntity

        Destroy entity:
            - ID: 0x0000
            - Request: DestroyEntity
